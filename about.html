                <h2>About my work</h2>
                 <article class="col-lg-8 about-article">
                    <p>"When I was in fifth grade, I had the opportunity to join the middle school band. I     wanted to play the Clarinet, or trumpet, or perhaps percussion. One day the private music teachers were invited to perform for the students and I heard the saxophone, in person, for the first time. I still remember hearing my future mentor play Dvorak's Humoresque, and feeling goosebumps all over my body. From that moment on I knew I wanted to play the sax.</p>
                    <p>I can't say whether I really had much talent in my early days of playing, but I loved music, more than anything else. It brought me so much happiness during what can be challenging years for a young person.</p>
                    <p>I began reed making when I was in my early teens, and did not have a knack for it at first.</p>
                    <p>Upon graduating from high school I did not know what I wanted to do with my future. I still loved music more than anything, but I did not feel confident in trying to apply to large schools with competitive music departments. I decided to go to community college, work part time, and try to figure out what my next step would be.</p> 
                    <p>I became obsessed with the saxophone and reed making during my years studying with Buga. Buga helped me to feel confident as a musician and reed maker. During this time I decided that I would start a reed making business upon graduation, which is what I did. Since then I have devoted a large part of my professional life to making reeds, along with performing and teaching.</p> 
                    <p>I look back to my early years studying, and think of how grateful I was to have access to good quality oboe reeds. I think that every saxophonist, no matter their age or ability should have access to great quality reeds that are affordable. This is an idea that drives my reed making.</p>
                    <p>I view the reed making process as an art form in some regards. I am constantly learning and developing new ways of thinking about the process, and developing more effective and efficient methods."</p>
